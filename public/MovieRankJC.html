<h1>The Best Movies According to James</h1>
<h2>My Three Top Sci-fi Movies of All time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Best Stand Alone Sci-Fi movie. Did not need any sequels but then came II and III and so on.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Element</h3>
<p>Ok, this actually is the best standalone Sci-fi movie. And it does stand-alone thankfully. No sequels!</p>
<h3>The Terminator II</h3>
<p>Now this is a sequel, but I like it purely for the scene where Arni and the kid are breaking his mother, Sarah Conner, out of the asylum. Sends a shiver down my spine when the psychiatrist character finally realises there is more to Sarah Conner's story than he can deal with.</p>
